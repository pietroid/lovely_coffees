## Getting Started üöÄ

First of all, run the build_runner to generate the necessary classes for the app to work properly:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

To run the app either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the command:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run
```

_\*Lovely coffee works on iOS and Android._

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
